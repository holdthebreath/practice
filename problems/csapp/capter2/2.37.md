1. This change does not help at all. Even though the computation of asize will be accurate, the call to malloc will cause this value to be converted to a 32-bit unsigned number, and so the same overflow conditions will occur.
2. 
  uint64_t require_size = ele_cnt * (uint64_t) ele_size;
  size_t request_size = (size_t) require_size;
  if (require_size != request_size) {
        // overflow
        return NULL;
  }
