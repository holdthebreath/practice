B

fun1's result is only 0x000000 + the least significant, because it left and right shift is unsigned and finally cast to signed.
fun2 firstly performs left shift, then cast result to int, finally right shift, so it's an arithmetically right.

answer:
Function fun1 extracts a value from the low-order 8 bits of the argument, giving an integer ranging between 0 and 255. 
Function fun2 extracts a value from the low order 8 bits of the argument, but **it also performs sign extension**. The result will be a number between -128 and 127.
