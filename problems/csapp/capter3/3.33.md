A C function pro cprob has four arguments u, a, v, and b. Each is either a signed number or a pointer to a signed number, where the numbers have different sizes. The function has the following body:
*u += a;
*v += b;
return sizeof(a) + sizeof(b);

It compiles to the following x86-64 code:

1	procprob:
2	movslq %edi, %rdi
3	addq %rdi, (%rdx)
4	addb %sil, (%rcx)
5	movl $6, %eax
6	ret

Determine a valid ordering and types of the four parameters. There are two correct answers.

a -> %edi b -> %sil u -> %rdx v -> %rcx
int       short     long*     char* 

b -> %edi a -> %sil v -> %rdx u -> %rcx
short     int       long*     char*
