A.
long fun_b(unsigned long x) {
    long val = 0;
    long i;
    for (i = 64; i != 0; i--) {
        val = (val << 1) | (x & 0x1);
        x >>= 1;
    }
    return val;
}

B.
The code was generated using the guarded-do transformation, but the compiler detected that, since i is initialized to 64, it will satisfy the test i â‰  0, and therefore the initial test is not required.

C.
This code reverses the bits in x, creating a mirror image. It does this by shifting the bits of x from left to right, and then filling these bits in as it shifts val from right to left.
