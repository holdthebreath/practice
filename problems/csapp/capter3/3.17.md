In most respects, the choice is arbitrary. But the original rule works better for the common case where there is no else statement. For this case, we can simply modify the translation rule to be as follows:

	t = test-expr;
	if (!t)
	  goto done;
then-statement
done:

A translation based on the alternate rule is more cumbersome.
