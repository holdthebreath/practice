Suppose we want to generate assembly code for the following C function:

long shift_left4_rightn(long x, long n)
{
    x ≪= 4;
    x ≫= n;
    return x;
}
The code that follows is a portion of the assembly code that performs the actual shifts and leaves the final value in register %rax.
Two key instructions have been omitted. Parameters x and n are stored in registers %rdi and %rsi, respectively.

long shift_left4_rightn(long x, long n)
x in %rdi, n in %rsi
shift_left4_rightn:
movq %rdi, %rax          Get x
salq $4, %rax               x <<= 4
movl %esi, %ecx             Get n (4 bytes)
sarq %cl, %rax              x >>= n
