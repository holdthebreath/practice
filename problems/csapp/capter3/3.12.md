Consider the following function for computing the quotient and remainder of two unsigned 64-bit numbers:

void uremdiv(unsigned long x, unsigned long y,
    unsigned long *qp, unsigned long *rp) {
    unsigned long q = x/y;
    unsigned long r = x%y;
    *qp = q;
    *rp = r;
}
Modify the assembly code shown for signed division to implement this function.

void uremdiv(long x, long y, long *qp, long *rp)
x in %rdi, y in %rsi, qp in %rdx, rp in %rcx
1	uremdiv:
2	 movq %rdx, %r8		Copy qp
3	 movq %rdi, %rax	Move x to lower 8 bytes of dividend
4	 movl $0, %edx
5	 divq %rsi		Divide by y
6	 movq %rax, (%r8)	Store quotient at qp
7	 movq %rdx, (%rcx)	Store remainder at rp
8	 ret
