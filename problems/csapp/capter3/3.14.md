The C code

int test(data_t a) {
return a TEST 0;
}
shows a general comparison between argument a and 0, where we can set the data type of the argument by declaring data_t with a typedef, and the nature of the comparison by declaring TEST with a #define declaration. The following instruction sequences implement the comparison, where a is held in some portion of register %rdi.
For each sequence, determine which data types data_t and which comparisons TEST could cause the compiler to generate this code. 
(There can be multiple correct answers; list all correct ones.)

A.
testq	%rdi, %rdi
setge	%al

long, >=

B.
testw	%di, %di
sete	%al

short/unsigned short, ==

C.
testb	%dil, %dil
seta	%al

unsigned char, >

D.
testl	%edi, %edi
setle	%al

int, <=
