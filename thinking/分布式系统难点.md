However, even though we have talked a lot about faults, the last few chapters have still been too optimistic. The
reality is even darker. We will now turn our pessimism to the maximum and assume that anything that can go wrong will go
wrong.i

Working with distributed systems is fundamentally different from writing software on a single computer—and the main
difference is that there are lots of new and exciting ways for things to go wrong

our task as engineers is to build systems that do their job (i.e., meet the guarantees that users are expecting), in
spite of everything going wrong.

If we want to make distributed systems work, we must accept the possibility of partial failure and build fault-tolerance
mechanisms into the software. In other words, we need to build a reliable system from unreliable components.

Even in smaller systems consisting of only a few nodes, it’s important to think about partial failure. In a small
system, it’s quite likely that most of the components are working correctly most of the time. However, sooner or later,
some part of the system will become faulty, and the software will have to somehow handle it. The fault handling must be
part of the software design, and you (as operator of the software) need to know what behavior to expect from the
software in the case of a fault.

If software is put in an unanticipated situation, it may do arbitrary unexpected things.
