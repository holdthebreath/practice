- BECOMING WARY OF ATTRIBUTING CAUSATION TO CIRCUMSTANCE IS A MENTAL MODEL ESSENTIAL TO MAKING GOOD DECISIONS, BOTH IN THE INVESTMENT REALM AND THE REAL WORLD.

Decisions based on faulty explanation or imaginary causation are like coin flips (or worse). Consequently, knowing how to sniff out when causation exists and when it doesn’t is critical . . . unless flipping a coin is your go-to decision-making model.
- THE CHICKEN AND THE EGG: THE DIFFICULTY IN DETERMINING CAUSATION
  - CONFUSING SYMPTOMS WITH CAUSES: We need to be careful not to ascribe causation when we think we see a pattern. Just because two variables are correlated doesn’t mean that one variable caused the other.“it’s possible that what you thought was a cause might instead be a symptom.
  - CAUSE OR COINCIDENCE: Always ask whether two simultaneously occurring events could be coincidental. If coincidence could explain the events, further digging is warranted to develop a causal link.
  - MULTIPLE CAUSES：we should be wary of causally linking two occurrences because without other causes, the link between them might be severed. A good way to think about multiple causes is that a cause, may be necessary for the result to occur, but may not be sufficient on its own to be the cause.
  - CORRELATION DOESN’T IMPLY CAUSATION
  - SPURIOUS CORRELATIONS：Completely unrelated factors can be highly correlated.
  - CORRELATED FACTORS MAY HAVE A COMMON CAUSE：Whenever we see two correlated variables, we should stop to ask whether they have a common cause rather than jumping to the conclusion that one variable caused the other.
- DETERMINING CAUSATION IS DIFFICULT
  
1. when one thing happens the other also happens doesn’t mean there’s a causal link. Unfortunately, our brains are wired to jump to those sorts of conclusions.
2. we need to build mental models around causation that recognize that our brains are prone to perceive causation where it doesn’t exist. Accordingly, it’s important to question presumed causal links and dig below the surface to test whether causation truly exists.

- REGRESSION TO THE MEAN

1. Regression to the mean is a statistical phenomenon in which extreme events are followed by those closer to the average.
2. Regression to the mean is a mathematical tendency that occurs whenever two variables aren’t perfectly correlated.
3. the truth is that regression to the mean has an explanation but does not have a cause
4. regression to the mean does not imply that everyone will end up around the average over the long term

- HOW REGRESSION TO THE MEAN RELATES TO INVESTING

1. Misunderstanding regression to the mean is commonplace in investing, and that can be costly, leading people to read too much into both good and bad outcomes that have no explanation other than math.

- WHAT INVESTORS SHOULD DO ABOUT REGRESSION TO THE MEAN

1. You can avoid making decisions based on reasons that simply aren’t there by making regression to the mean a mental model that you turn to first, before casting about for causes. 

- THE LAW OF LARGE NUMBERS

1. The importance of considering sample size results from the law of large numbers, which holds that as a sample size grows, the average (mean) of the sample gets closer to that of the whole population.

- THE MOST DANGEROUS EQUATION

1. the sample size decreases, the variability from the average increases exponentially
2. Small sample sizes skew results. Because variability increases exponentially as the sample size decreases, it’s easy to be surprised and sometimes wrongly impressed by the results of small sample sizes. Asking “what’s the sample size?” is the most critical question when evaluating data, and it’s a vital mental model to have in your tool kit. When sample sizes are too small, mistaken conclusions are the norm.

- THE HIGHLY IMPROBABLE HAPPENS ALL THE TIME

1. coincidental events only seem extraordinary due to improper framing or a misunderstanding of the laws of probability. While it seems counterintuitive, the highly improbable happens all the time.
2. it is probable that improbable things will happen. Granted this, one might argue that what is improbable is probable
3. Understanding that the highly improbable occurs rather commonly is an essential mental model. It may make the world seem less mystical and fantastic, but it will also help us to see things more clearly and make better decisions knowing that the unexpected is our constant companion.

THE MENTAL MODELS AND HOW TO APPLY THEM

1. It’s risky to think that one thing has caused another.
2. Correlation does not imply causation. Just because two things are strongly correlated doesn’t mean that one causes the other
3. Regression to the mean describes the phenomenon whereby extreme events are usually followed by ones closer to the average.
4. Beware of drawing conclusions based on small sample sizes.
5. the highly improbable happens all the time.
