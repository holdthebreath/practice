The only function of economic forecasting is to make astrology look respectable.

**even the most esteemed and successful financial experts have no more idea what the future holds than any of us do.**

1. Trying to predict the future is a waste of time and breath because unexpected events such as global pandemics, wars,
   and natural disasters occur all the time.
2. Even when unexpected events become known, predicting how the stock market will react is problematic. It’s like
   throwing darts at a dartboard blindfolded.
3. **The lesson is that your first reaction should be skepticism, not reliance, when you hear an economic or market
   forecast.**

- OVERCONFIDENCE

1. **confidence is inversely related to the ability to predict the future**
2. We should always be wary of overconfidence. While we’re wired to crave confident-sounding predictions, we need to
   train ourselves not to listen to them.
3. **we should embrace the inherent uncertainty of the future and learn to sit in our discomfort.**
4. Making changes to our portfolios or other aspects of our lives **based on our confidence in our predictive abilities
   is likely to turn out badly**.

- THE ILLUSION OF VALIDITY

1. The problem is that many of the patterns we see are meaningless. But our brains insist on finding coherence—a narrative when there is none.This drive to discover patterns and explain them is a major factor in overconfidence.
2. As long as the explanation we construct is coherent, we trust it. We can’t help it. Explanations give us confidence that we understand the world, and that makes us feel safe.
3. Our reluctance to acknowledge unpredictability keeps us looking for predictive cues well beyond the point of diminishing returns.
