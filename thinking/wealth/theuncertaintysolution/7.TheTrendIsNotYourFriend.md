There are challenges to investing in trends that every investor should know about. Let’s hit the big ones:
1.  it’s difficult to spot a trend early
2. trends don’t always turn out as imagined 
3. it’s difficult to find a successful needle in a haystack of competitors.

2. Predicting how a trend will evolve is tough.
