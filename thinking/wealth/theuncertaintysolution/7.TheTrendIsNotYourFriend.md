A trend is a trend is a trend. But the question is, will it bend? Will it alter its course through some unforeseen force and come to a premature end?

There are challenges to investing in trends that every investor should know about. Let’s hit the big ones:
1.  it’s difficult to spot a trend early
2. trends don’t always turn out as imagined 
3. it’s difficult to find a successful needle in a haystack of competitors.

- IT’S DIFFICULT TO SPOT A TREND EARLY

1.  **It’s challenging to discern fantasy from reality in the early stages of an emerging trend or technology, and great ideas often seem outlandish near their inception.** (AI?)
2. Predicting how a trend will evolve is tough.

- EXPONENTIAL GROWTH MAKES TRENDSPOTTING PROBLEMATIC

1. Trends are hard to spot in the early stages because they don’t produce significant change at first. They tend to start small and grow incrementally. But as growth builds on growth, fundamental change breaks through.
2. A key feature of exponential growth is that it seems to **start gradually and then accelerates over time**. Unfortunately, humans generally are linear thinkers and don’t easily grasp how exponential growth can create extraordinary change.
3. **Repeated doubling, which is a type of exponential growth**, is an explosive process and one for which our minds are ill-equipped.
