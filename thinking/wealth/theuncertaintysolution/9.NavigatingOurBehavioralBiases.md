The foundation of political economy and, in general, of every social science, is evidently psychology.

- THE ENDOWMENT EFFECT

1. **We all overvalue what we have.** This is a behavioral bias called the endowment effect.
2. In addition to the endowment effect, there are hundreds of built-in biases that color our thinking and decision making. These biases persist because they aided our survival in an ancient world of scarcity and mortal risk that rewarded what our brains told us was the safer course. Other biases evolved because of our need to be part of a social group and seek status because belonging and status improved an individual’s chances of survival and reproductive success.
3. Behavioral biases don’t just distort the perceived value of our possessions; they lead us to make poor decisions in every aspect of our lives, including investments.

- STORYTELLING BIAS

  **We rarely stop to consider base rate probabilities. Instead, it’s human nature to view the world through stories and ignore, as Kahneman put it, “the statistics of the class to which the case belongs.**
   - STORIES ARE MORE POWERFUL THAN FACTS
     1. Storytelling allowed us to create and share complicated ideas efficiently, and stories enable large groups of strangers to identify and work together.
     2. Everything that Harari mentions (nations, laws, money) is conceptual; none of it has a physical reality; they’re agreed-upon fictions. 
     3. **Stories have the almost magical ability to make events and things that don’t tangibly exist inculcate values**
     4. Stories lead people to believe in shared goals and purposes.
     5. Much of our interactions with other people consists of telling stories.
     6. Because we’ve evolved to be storytellers and story exchangers, **we pay special attention to stories; they greatly influence our worldview and our decisions.**
     7. **A single story can exert more sway over our decisions than reams of data, analysis, and statistics.**
   - BASE RATE IGNORANCE
     1. Stories about a single patient’s experience made the study participants throw the base rate out the window and make a bad decision.
   - BAD BLOOD
     1. **A compelling story can lead to a bad investment**（AI?）
   - STORY LESSONS
     1. **The world of investing is full of stories.**
     2. **we’re swayed by them because that’s how we’re wired.**
     3. Developing a mental model about stories is essential to successful investing. That starts with **understanding that a story will have an outsized effect on your decision making.**
     4. **Train yourself to seek out the base rate (as with farmers and librarians or drug treatment options) and add that to the mix.**
     5. **Learn to recognize when you’re being told a story and realize that the story will have an outsized effect on your decision making.**
