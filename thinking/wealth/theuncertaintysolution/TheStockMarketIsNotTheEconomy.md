1. the small actions of individuals can cause broad, disproportionate, and often irrational outcomes for the system.

- THE ECONOMY DOESN’T PREDICT THE STOCK MARKET

1. the stock market is not the economy; economic news does not predict what will happen in the market.

- THE ECONOMY AND THE STOCK MARKET ARE NOT CORRELATED

1. The stock market and the economy are related, but that doesn’t mean they rise and fall in tandem. Just because the economy is contracting doesn’t mean that the stock market will decline. History shows us that GDP growth is not a good predictor of future stock prices.
2. investor decision making tends to anticipate the economy’s changed circumstances, and the empirical evidence supports this claim. Stock market fluctuations predict changes in GDP, but movements in GDP do not predict stock market returns. Over time, forward-looking predictions of economic change are incorporated in today’s fluctuations in the stock market.
