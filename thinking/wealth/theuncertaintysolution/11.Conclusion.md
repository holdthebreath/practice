- THERE’S GRANDEUR IN THIS VIEW OF INVESTING

1. What Darwin proposed in the book, of course, was that life-forms evolve. Specifically, organisms change due to the combination of three factors:
   1. mutation
   2. selection for or against those mutations
   3. **time—lots and lots of it.**
2. Evolution relies on randomness and chance; it is unpredictable.
3. **Initially, it’s tough to accept that predictions are useless, and no investment guru can consistently provide you with market-beating returns. Or that successful investing requires focusing on our own behaviors and fighting against our hard-wired biases.**
4. **the uncertainty, randomness, and complexity of the economy and the financial markets are fantastic and beautiful.**
5. **As we live our lives, we ride this wave of uncertainty. We all face an unpredictable future.**
6. **Ignoring this reality will not make you a better investor. That’s “the uncertainty solution”—accepting the world as it is.**
7. **Instead of searching in vain for certainty in a world and a market that does not and will never contain it, we’re better off accepting things as they are and paying attention to what we can control: our own behavior.**
8. **We can best do this by focusing on creating a latticework of mental models that will help us make better decisions.**
