1. First: Markets move in cycles.
2. Second: Market cycles cannot be consistently timed profitably.

- STABILITY LEADS TO INSTABILITY

1. stability itself is destabilizing because, during times of economic stability, healthy investments lead to speculative euphoria, increasing financial leverage, and over-extension of debt.
2. This eventually results in a “Minsky moment,” the point where everyone realizes there are problems—and panic ensues. At this point, a recession or even a financial crisis occurs. Then the whole cycle starts over.


- HOW MINSKY’S INSIGHT CAN HELP US BE BETTER INVESTORS

1. As we move through market cycles, we can’t know when the next phase will happen because the tops and bottoms of market cycles are only known in retrospect. A confounding factor is that **the euphoria and panic stages tend to last longer than most people expect**.
2. **it is possible to roughly know where we are in the cycle, and we can use that knowledge to inform good strategies.**

7. When profit-taking and panic occur, both investors and businesses can redeploy their safety margin into assets that have declined in value.
8. **the most significant risk in investing occurs when everything seems to be going well, while the panic found deep in a bear market or recession often provides the best investment opportunities.**
9. **waiting until everything seems relatively safe and the economy is healthy is not a profitable strategy.**
10. **Stay fully invested through good times and bad**
11. not to capitulate to the fear that comes with the panicky part of the cycle or indulge in the greed that accompanies the euphoria.
12. While it’s not possible to accurately time the market’s tops and bottoms, understanding the cycle and knowing roughly where you are can help you maintain a sane investment strategy when everyone around you is going nuts.

- THE FUTILITY OF MARKET TIMING

1. Forecasting the future is a mug’s game

- WHAT IS MARKET TIMING?

1. **you’re market timing when you tinker with your portfolio based on what you think will happen in the markets**.
